# memory-game
-Introduction
The Memory game is a classic card-matching game where the player flip two cards at a time to try to find matching pairs. The goal is to match all pairs with the fewest moves possible. This game strengthens logic skills and reinforces DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
##  How to Play
1. Click the "Start" or refresh the page to begin.
2. Flip two cards at a time.
3. If they match, they stay visible.
4. If not, they flip back after a short delay.
5. Match all the pairs to win
 ##  Why I Chose This Game 
I enjoy games that test concentration and memory

 **Play the game here**: [https://your-username.github.io/memory-game/](https://your-username.github.io/memory-game/)  
üìÅ **Project planning and pseudocode**: See the [Planning Section](#-pseudocode-game-logic)


##  Minimum Requirements
1. HTML & CSS

A grid of face-down cards using Flexbox

Clear instructions visible on the screen

2. JavaScript

When a player clicks a card, it flips and reveals its emoji

Two cards can be flipped at a time

If the cards match, they remain face-up and become unclickable

When all pairs are matched, display a message in the HTML like:

‚úÖ "You win!"

üîÑ "Play again" button

3. DOM Manipulation  

4. Git + GitHub
  
## pseudocode 
1.Set up game board:Create an array of card objects (each image appears twice)
Shuffle the card array
For each card:
    Create a card element
    Add front and back faces
    Add click event listener to flip the card
    Append to the game board

2.Track game state: 
flippedCards = []      // Max 2 cards at a time
matchedCards = []      // Store matched cards
isBusy = false          // Prevent interaction while checking

3.Card click logic:If is Busy or card already matched or flipped:return Flip the card
Add it to flippedCards

If flippedCards has 2 cards:
    isBusy = true
    Wait 1 second
    If the two cards match:
        Keep them flipped
        Add to matchedCards
    Else:
        Flip them back down
    Clear flippedCards
    isBusy = false

4.Check for win:If matchedCards.length equals total cards:Show win message

5.Reset game:Clear board Shuffle cards againReset all variables Recreate and render cards
 
## future enhancements
Timer & Score System ‚Äì Track how fast the player wins and count the number of moves.

Difficulty Levels ‚Äì Add Easy, Medium, and Hard modes with different grid sizes.

Two-Player Mode ‚Äì Let two players take turns and compete for the best score.
