# memory-game
A fun and simple memory-matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to match all the emoji pairs as quickly as possible!
##  How to Play
1. Click the "Start" or refresh the page to begin.
2. Flip two cards at a time.
3. If they match, they stay visible.
4. If not, they flip back after a short delay.
5. Match all the pairs to win
 ##  Why I Chose This Game 

I enjoy games that test concentration and memory
##  Technologies Used
- HTML,CSS (Flexbox layout)
  A grid of face-down cards
  Clear instructions somewhere on the screen
- JavaScript (DOM, logic, event handling)
When the player clicks a cards, it flips and shows its image
The player can flip two cards at a time
If the two cards match, they stay face-up and can't be clicked again
Once all card pairs are matched, display message in HTML like : "You win" or also "Play again"
